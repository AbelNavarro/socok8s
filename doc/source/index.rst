Welcome to SUSE Containerized OpenStack Technology Preview
==========================================================

The socok8s project automates SUSE Containerized OpenStack provisioning and
lifecycle management on SUSE Container as a Service Platform (CaaSP) and
SUSE Enterprise Storage (SES), using Airship, OpenStack Helm, shell scripts,
and Ansible playbooks.

As a technology preview, this is not meant for production use and a typical
support subscription is not being offered. Some of the functionality currently
in our generally available SUSE OpenStack Cloud product is not available in
this tech preview. This technology preview gives users and partners the
ability to test and see the new technologies that may be offered in SUSE's
future releases.

This release deploys the following set of core OpenStack services:

  * Keystone
  * Glance
  * Cinder
  * Nova
  * Neutron
  * Heat
  * Horizon

This technology preview will not be moved into a production support mode of
operation. The underlying technology is being considered for the future release
of SUSE OpenStack Cloud product. There is a possibility of refreshing the
capabilities of the technology preview later.

This technology preview is provided under the terms of the Apache-2.0 license.

Please provide your feedback using the beta mailing lists that are documented
on the technology preview download page or your SUSE representative. We are
very interested in your experience and use cases.
