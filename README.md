# Intro

This project automates the deployment of OpenStack-Helm (OSH) on
SUSE Container as a Service Platform (CaaSP) and SUSE Enterprise
Storage (SES) via a series of shell scripts and Ansible playbooks.

# General requirements

## Ansible

You need to install Ansible 2.7 or later to run these playbooks.

## Cloning this repository

To get started, you need to clone this repository. This repository
uses submodules, so you need to get all the code to make sure
the playbooks work.


```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SUSE-Cloud/socok8s.git
```

Alternatively, one can fetch/update the tree of the submodules by
running:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# Deployment on SUSE engcloud

## Installing base software on your local machine

On the system you plan to deploy OSH from, you'll need to install some
software and create local configuration.

You need to have the following software installed:
* ansible>=2.7.0
* python-openstackclient
* jq
* git

## Configure engcloud

You can access the engcloud web UI at https://engcloud.prv.suse.net/.
For more information, see https://wiki.microfocus.net/index.php/SUSE/ECP.

Make sure your environment have an openstack client configuration file.
For that, you can create the `~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml`.

Replace the username and password with your appropriate credentials
in the following example:

```
clouds:
  engcloud:
    region_name: CustomRegion
    auth:
      auth_url: https://engcloud.prv.suse.net:5000/v3
      username: foctodoodle # your username here
      password: my-super-secret-password # your password here
      project_name: cloud
      project_domain_name: default
      user_domain_name: ldap_users
    identity_api_version: 3
    cacert: /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/SUSE_Trust_Root.crt.pem
ansible:
  use_hostnames: True
  expand_hostvars: False
  fail_on_errors: True
```

If you don't have the SUSE root certificate installed, check
http://ca.suse.de/.

You'll also need to pre-create some configuration in engcloud. It's
convention here to use your username as part of the name of objects you create.

Create a keypair on engcloud (using either the engcloud web interface or
OpenStack CLI's `openstack keypair create`)
for accessing the instances created. Remember the name of this
keypair (which appears as `foctodoodle-key` in the example below)

Create a network with a subnet. Take
note of the network name you used (`foctodoodle-net`), and the subnet
name (`foctodoodle-subnet`).

Create a router with the `floating` external network.  Then open the
router and add an interface to the network you created.

Define the following environment variables prior to running the
socok8s scripts:

```
# assuming you followed the example
export OS_CLOUD=engcloud
# the name of the keypair you created
export KEYNAME=foctodoodle-key
# your username plus whatever else you'd like, will be used for naming
# objects you create in engcloud
export PREFIX=foctodoodle
# the name of the subnet you created
export INTERNAL_SUBNET=foctodoodle-subnet
```

Prior to executing scripts, be aware that you may need to do some
cleanup prior to retrying scripts or playbooks should they fail. In
some steps a delete.sh script is provided to clean up any created
resources. Reconfirming that you've done all the previous steps to set
up now will save you some time later.

## Deploying

To begin a deployment from scratch, go to the root of your socok8s
clone and run:

```
./run.sh
```

The default action for `run.sh` is to do a `full-deploy` on openstack.
This means the `runi.sh` script will run each of the seven top-level
sections of the script in order.

## Re-deploying OSH

If you only want to redeploy the last step, openstack-helm,
you can run the following:

```
# (Optional): Cleanup k8s from all previous deployment code
./run.sh clean_k8s
```

```
# Re-deploy OpenStack-Helm
./run.sh deploy_osh
```

# Deployment using KVM

This is not currently supported, but is a planned future addition.


# run.sh

The `run.sh` script accepts two arguments in the form:

```
./run.sh <subcommand> <deploy_mechanism>
```

The `<subcommand>` can be one of the following:
* `full_deploy`: This is the default subcommand. It deploys all the
  necessary requirements on `$deploy_mechanism`, and then deploys
  OpenStack-Helm by calling `deploy_osh` subcommand.

* `deploy_osh`: This subcommand runs the 'step 7' plays, deploying
  OpenStack-Helm.

* `teardown`: This subcommand deletes all evidences of the deployment
  on the `$deploy_mechanism`, and then removes all user files from
  localhost. Destructive operation.

* `clean_k8s`: This subcommand removes all known openstack-helm
  deployment artifacts from the k8s cluster. It removes user content,
  namespaces, persistent volumes, etc.  This is a destructive operation.

The `<deploy_mechanism>` is by default "openstack".
No alternative option is implemented yet, but we might implement a
KVM based deployment mechanism.
